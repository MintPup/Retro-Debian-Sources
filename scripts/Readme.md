All scripts here are for Retro-Debian project and have GNU GPLv3 license. No warranty of any kind.


Mostly CLI scripts will be uploaded here. All should work with dash, ash and bash.

Many of them are only few lines and mostly modified from some linux commands man pages. You will not find license or author
inside such short and simple scripts, but since the source for them is GPL they should have the same license in my opinion.

The code inside is modification for my needs from examples found in linux forums and man pages like:

I can't identify with sure all people who should get credits for the included code so feel free to write me an e-mail
in case you see parts of your code here without source link and I will update the information.
