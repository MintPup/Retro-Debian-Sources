# Retro-Debian-Sources

Slowly resuming my work on Retro-Debian project.
This repository includes the [source iso images.](https://github.com/MintPup/Retro-Debian-Sources/releases/tag/v.1.0)
Maybe other source packages and scripts will be uploaded here later.

I will try to follow [DFSG.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian_Free_Software_Guidelines) If you can find here something useful I'm glad but I will develop this project for my own needs only. The targets are very old Pentium-II and Pentium-III computers. I will use older version of live-boot-2.15 with some modifications I made [here a year ago.](https://github.com/MintPup/DebianDog-Wheezy/tree/master/live-boot-2)
